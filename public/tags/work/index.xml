      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I read the transcript of Hamming&amp;rsquo;s You and your research talk found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and that’ll be the 2nd material of his I’ll come in contact with. I think it’s a good idea to write down its essence for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-choose-work&#34;&gt;How to choose work:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think before you work. Just hard work is not enough - it must be applied sensibly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on important problems. At least with these, the unavoidable struggle to make something could be worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on solutions you can see. “It&amp;rsquo;s not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on scalable solutions. Do not solve an isolated problem except as characteristic of a class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on things you’re bold about. “Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-work&#34;&gt;How to work:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t let up. “The good man gets on with the job, given what he&amp;rsquo;s got, and gets the best answer he can”. Alter the problem if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice tolerating ambiguity. Don’t wait to know everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you choose one thing, let go of all else and keep your thoughts on it. Your subconscious will appreciate this clarity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can educate your bosses. If you want to do something, don&amp;rsquo;t ask, do it. Present them with an accomplished fact. Don&amp;rsquo;t give them a chance to tell you “No“.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to work with the system, and you will go as far as the system will support you. Or you can fight it steadily, as a small undeclared war, for the whole of your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;appearance of conforming&lt;/em&gt; gets you a long way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to use yourself. Your ego is good when used for your benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For creative living, get your problems clear and refuse to look at any answers until you&amp;rsquo;ve thought of a solution. E.g read to be updated, not to copy answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After acheiving competency in a field, pivot. It takes courage to say, “Yes, I will give up my great reputation”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-people-do-not-do-great-work&#34;&gt;Why people do not do great work:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they don&amp;rsquo;t work on important problems,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they don&amp;rsquo;t become emotionally involved,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they don&amp;rsquo;t try and change what is difficult to what is easily done but is still important,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they keep giving themselves alibis for this hesitation to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>
