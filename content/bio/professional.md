### PhD, Computational Biophysics


In December 2021, I came to the US on an F1 to study Bioinformatics 
at Georgia State University. 
I met Dr Gozem, my now supervisor during my Masters and liked working with him. 
I also met the other members of his lab and enjoyed talking theoretical chemistry 
and life with them.
I joined the Gozem lab and began learning from them, still am. 


### BSc, Biochemistry
When I was 15, I got admitted to Landmark University, Kwara State, Nigeria 
to study Biochemistry.
I was new to the acedemy and curious. 
By the second year, the chemistry and biochemistry began to make sense 
and I saw I had a connection with it.
I also met friends I have till today and some objectively good professors.
