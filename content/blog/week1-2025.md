i want to continue posting online regularly. 

hence this first post. 

i started learning ml with andrew ng's [ml specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction).


### notes:

1. last week, i took a hpc course from uc boulder and took some notes. i am going to make a post about it.
2. i learned qchem prints S0 -> SX transition energies at SX optimized geometry, so this is technically not adiabatic excitation energy. at the back of my mind, i am going "why would they do that instead of SX energy at SX optimized geometry - S0 energy at S0 optimized geometry?", which is indeed what i typically need when doing calculations. apparently, S2 energy at S2 energy - S0 energy at S2 minimum is called the vertical emission energy, while, the adiabatic excitation energy (AEE) is instead the S2 energy at the S2 minimum - S0 energy at the S0 geometry and i didn't know the difference.
3. i learned a trick to color the files and folders differently in the terminal - `ls --color`. added this as an ls alias in my `.bashrc` and i like the view.
