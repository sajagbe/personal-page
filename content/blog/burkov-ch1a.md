he wasted no time with this book. 

page 1 and i learned an intuitive definition for ml.

```
it is training a computer to do things without giving it explicit rules.

it is giving the computer a bunch of data and letting it figure out the
best mathematical description of the data, then using that description
to solve a problem of personal interest.

```





### notes:

1. i had used "model" and "algorithm" interchangeably. inaccurate. the ml algorithm is the method the computer uses to learn the mathematical description of the relationships in the data. the model is the relationships learned.
